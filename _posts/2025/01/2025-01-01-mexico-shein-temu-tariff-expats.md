## Shein, Temu, and the $50 Rule

If you've been living in Mexico for a while, you might already know about the famous "$50 exemption" on imported goods.  

For years, individuals could import items worth **under $50 USD** duty-free through couriers like DHL, FedEx, or UPS.  

**Guess who exploited that rule?**  
- Shein, Temu, AliExpress, and dozens of other Chinese e-commerce giants.

Rather than using bulk cargo or paying proper customs, they flooded Mexico with **millions of tiny shipments** â€” all individually "under $50."  

The result? **Massive growth** for ultra-cheap fast fashion... and **major headaches** for Mexican retailers trying to compete.

## Mexico Cracks Down

In **April 2025**, the Mexican government finally **closed the loophole**.  
Now, **any importâ€”even under $50â€”must pay full customs duties** unless specifically exempted by trade treaties like USMCA (T-MEC).  

Officials cited three reasons:
- **Protect local industries** from unfair competition
- **Raise revenue** lost to duty-free small shipments
- **Curb informal imports** bypassing safety and consumer rules

**Customs fees can now add 20â€“30%** (or more) to the price of low-cost Shein, Temu, or AliExpress items.

> ðŸ§  **Quick Fact:**  
> Shein alone reportedly moved **over 30 million parcels into Mexico in 2024** under the $50 exemption. ([Source: El Financiero](#sources))

## Why Expats Should Care

At first glance, you might think:  
_"So what? I just wanted cheap clothes or housewares!"_

But here's why it matters:

### 1. Higher Costs at the Border
Expect **higher delivery charges, longer customs clearance times**, and **possible taxes due at pickup** even for small orders.

### 2. Local Businesses Get Breathing Room
Family-run clothing stores, local boutiques, and independent artisans **suffered deeply** from Shein/Temu's price war. This move gives them a **fairer chance** to surviveâ€”and thrive.

### 3. Economic Impact on Your Community
Small business is the **backbone of Mexicoâ€™s economy**, especially in tourism zones like Baja Sur, Oaxaca, and Quintana Roo. Supporting locals isn't charityâ€”**it's good economics** if you want vibrant communities.
